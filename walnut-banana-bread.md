Ingredients:

1. 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2. 1 teaspoon baking soda
3. 1/2 teaspoon salt
4. 1 cup brown sugar
5. 1 stick butter, plus more for prep
6. 2 eggs
7. 3 overripe bananas
8. 1 cup crushed toasted walnuts
9. 1/2 teaspoon vanilla

Tools:

1. 9x5x3 inch loaf pan

Prep:

1. We're going to cream the butter and sugar later, so make sure the butter is at room temperature. If refrigerated, let the butter sit out for at least an hour. We want the butter to be soft, but not melted.
2. Grease the interior of the pan with extra butter.
3. Mash the bananas into a chunky paste.
4. Combine and sift flour, salt, and baking soda in a mixing bowl.
5. In a separate bowl, combine the butter and brown sugar and cream them together. If you don't have a mechanical mixing contraption, just blend them with a wooden spoon until your arms fall off.
6. Combine eggs, bananas, vanilla with creamed sugar and stir until well-blended.
7. Combine sugar mixture with flour mixture and mix until incorporated.
8. Fold nuts into batter.
9. Pour batter into pan.

Cook:

1. Place in oven at 350F for about one hour.
2. To gauge cookedness, insert a toothpick into the center of the loaf. If the toothpick comes out clean, it's done.
3. Remove from oven and let sit for five minutes.
4. Remove from pan. Devour immediately, preferably topped with even more butter and some jam.
