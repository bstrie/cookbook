Ingredients:
    1. Bacon
    2. Grinder of black peppercorns

Prep:
    1. To trivialize cleanup, place aluminum foil on a baking sheet such that no grease will escape onto the baking sheet.
    2. Place bacon on the sheet. Pack em close, cram em in, make lots of bacon. Just don't let the strips touch or they'll want to stick together and make elegant extraction slightly more difficult.
    3. Pepper the bacon.
    4. Once done peppering the bacon, go back and pepper the bacon again. We can't reach the other side of the bacon to pepper it, you see, so we'll just have to pepper this side twice. Trust me, I'm a legit scientist.
    5. Put some more pepper on. Couldn't hurt. If you can still see meat, you aren't trying hard enough.
    6. Pepper the FUCK out of this bacon, is what I am saying.

Cook:
    1. Place in oven at 350F for... a while. The exact cooking time will vary based on the thickness of your bacon and the properties of your oven, and how crunchy you like it too. Should take at least 20 minutes, keep a close watch on it. Burnt bacon is the death of breakfast. For chewy bacon, remove once the pinkest bits become ever-so-slightly less pink. Be sure to get this in the oven early, since this takes longer to cook than pretty much every other thing that you might be making for breakfast concurrently.
    2. Remove pan from oven, remove bacon from pan. Let strips sit on paper towels to soak up the extra grease (don't worry, they'll still be deliciously greasy afterward).
    3. Serve warm, preferably while piled atop waffles with eggs and avocado.
